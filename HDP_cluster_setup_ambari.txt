In this article below, we will go through the steps to be followed to 
get a Hadoop 2.x cluster running on a private data centre.

We will be using Ambari's latest release to setup the cluster with below 6 machines -

1. Quad core machines with 8GB + RAM.
2. CentOS/RHEL 6 as OS

The 6 machines are as below -
hadoop-ambari
hadoop-nn
hadoop-dn1
hadoop-dn2
hadoop-dn3
hadoop-dn4

Prepare the hosts file on the Ambari server for above servers.
Also create a separate hosts.txt on the Ambari server machine -

root@hadoop-ambari$ cat hosts.txt
hadoop-nn
hadoop-dn1
hadoop-dn2
hadoop-dn3
hadoop-dn4

[Run the prepare-cluster.sh on the Ambari server, This will create a passphrase-less entry on each machine on cluster]

[Now run install-ambari-server.sh on Ambari server, that will install ambari on Ambari server]

Once the Ambari is installed, access Ambari from browser -
http://myhadoop-Ambari:8080
admin/admin is the default username and password. 

Installing Hadoop from the Web UI is fairly straight forward and will only ask for the hosts list and the SSH key
which we have on our ambari server.
